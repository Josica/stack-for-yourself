  <p>Learning to code is <a href="https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard">really damn hard</a>, so remember that it's not just you, and don't give up. Your <a href="https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/the-beginner-s-dilemma-your-first-100-hours-of-code">first 100 hours</a> are probably going to be especially difficult, if you're truly challenging yourself, but you'll do better if you always know how the specific thing you're learning fits into your overall plan.</p>

  <p>If you're absolutely a raw beginner, start with Paul Ford's <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">"What is Code?"</a> essay. And be sure to understand how to best use this site by checking out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/stack-for-yourself/roadmap/">roadmap</a>!</p>
