# Hello world!

You want to learn how to program. Hopefully you want to specifically learn to build web applications. Awesome!

This site is an aggregation of resources from around the web to help you in your quest. **To get the most use out of it: browse first, then come back when you're ready to jump into one of the topics on which I've collected resources.**

You'll be better off not turning to this site when you have questions that need answering: Google, StackOverflow, Reddit, Github issues, etc are much more likely to be good there. Instead, come here when you're ready to explore a new topic.

So if you want to learn about [CSS]({{ site.baseurl }}/stack-for-yourself/) and need resources to start, this is the right site for you. If you want to understand why `height: 100%` doesn't quite work the same way `width: 100%` seems to, StackOverflow is probably a better bet.

Developers, depending on what area of code they're working on, need to know a variety of things in order to be effective. ([Some don't always use this knowledge for company purposes, of course...](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts)) And they always have to be learning, as new things are created and start getting widely implemented all the time.

# Here's places that can help lay out a roadmap for you

## Learning on your own
[Go from Zero to Programmer Hero in One Guide!](http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/learn-code/)! But in truth there's a lot of [cool discussions, like this Quora one,](https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-designing-a-syllabus-to-take-a-newbie-like-me-from-a-coding-zero-to-a-Full-Stack-Web-Dev-Hero-in-6-months-and-under-1000-what-would-you-tell-me-to-learn-and-what-online-resources-should-I-use) about how to get into web development when you're a raw beginner to programming generally that are worth checking out. Check out the huge multitude of free resources, like  this [damn good list of where to start learning Rails and general webdev concepts](http://www.unforgivableruby.com/post/114752678529/learning-web-developmentrails-without-spending) before you consider bootcamp!

* [Web technology for developers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)
* [Code.org courses](https://code.org/learn)
* [Viking School prep course](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/prep)
* [IRN app, JS-based course to learn programming](http://lrnapp.com/)
* [Code Avengers: various free courses to learn basics](https://www.codeavengers.com/profile#intro)
* [TreeHouse, various small courses](https://teamtreehouse.com/)
* [KhanAcademy courses](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
* [Bento](https://bento.io/), cool tutorials for different web development technologies and concepts.
* [Learn the Hard Way courses](http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html), highly recommended.
* [Codeschool](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/): lots of great, interactive tutorials, especially geared towards raw beginners. Some of them are behind paywalls, but it's very reasonable pricing.
* [Videos at Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/)

## Learning with some help
I really like the idea of [mastery learning](http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/09/how-startups-are-solving-a-decades-old-problem-in-education/), which is when you learn or are taught a concept until you master it, before moving on. Ideally, you do it with the help of a mentor or community. Here's some places to do that:

* [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io/web-developer-career-track): a paid bootcamp whose model is to connect you with a developer who acts as a mentor.
* [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/): similarly to Bloc.io, a paid bootcamp program connecting you to a mentor.
* [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming): completely free, Ruby-based fullstack development program, with an amazing online community.
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/): superb, completely free program, teaching from the frontend backwards, with an excellent and huge community which in many cities has local presence. Actively maintained and being expanded to include new courses such as one teaching D3.js.
