# Hello world!

**Who you are:** You want to learn how to program. Hopefully you want to specifically learn to build web applications. Or you're already a developer and want to keep working on your skills. Awesome!

**What this site is:** This site is an aggregation of resources from around the web to help you in your quest. ***To get the most out of this site: browse first, then come back when you're ready to jump into one of the topics more deeply.***

You'll be better off not turning to this site when you have questions that need answering: Google, StackOverflow, Reddit, Github issues, etc are much more likely to be better. Instead, come here when you're ready to explore a new topic.

So if you want to learn about [CSS]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/01/01/frontend-part-1-html-css-dom/) and need resources to start, this is the right site for you. If you want to understand why `height: 100%` doesn't quite work the same way `width: 100%` seems to, StackOverflow is better.

## You need to know a variety of things, all of which are continually changing.

Developers, depending on what area of code they're working on, need to know a variety of things in order to be effective. ([Some don't always use this knowledge for company purposes, of course...](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts)) And they always have to be learning, as new things are created and start getting widely implemented all the time.

## Your essential competencies--and your full-stack roadmap!

<img src="https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1409261668002.png" width="100%">

* Be able to type very well, quickly, and cleanly. Try [typing.io](https://typing.io/) to level up.
* Get very comfortable with the command line. Learn the heck out of git.
* Learn a language that plays nice with the web, like Ruby, Python, Go, C++, Node.js, PHP, or Java. (Don't let yourself get lost in the crazy and often ridiculously arrogant comparison-mongering mobs that will scream at you that Ruby is dying or C++ is too hard: every single one of these languages has an excellent history, great community of contributors and users, and makes millions if not billions of dollars for the companies that use them. Every one of these are great for web development for their own reasons.)
* Learn the language you've chosen by solving small problems and graduating to more challenging ones. Create games for the console and write small programs, like [to-do lists](https://github.com/mindplace/nifty_things/tree/master/To_do_list) or the [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) game.
* Drown in algorithms and data structures. Know your way around essential concepts like Object Oriented Programming. Everything you learn at this stage will only improve your grasp of the backend language you've chosen.
* Learn how the web works, how requests are made, where code lives, how servers listen for and respond to queries.
* Learn a web framework for the backend language you chose.
* Learn how to setup and use databases with your projects. Get really comfortable with SQL syntax.
* Be able to create simple pages with HTML and CSS.
* Learn JavaScript. No whining. Be able to write vanilla JavaScript both in the sense of objects and in the sense of DOM manipulations.
* Learn about the DOM and the way JavaScript interacts with HTML & CSS. While you're at it, learn jQuery.
* Choose a frontend JavaScript framework and learn it. Just choose one to start.
* Learn to deploy your code to servers, using services like Heroku, and share your code on Github.  
* Build projects to showcase every single aspect of your learning. Essential projects include building an API of some sort.
* Honestly, build as much as possible. Have ideas and work to make them happen.

# Here's some other roadmaps:

## Learning on your own
[Go from Zero to Programmer Hero in One Guide!](http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/learn-code/) But really there's a lot of [cool discussions](https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-designing-a-syllabus-to-take-a-newbie-like-me-from-a-coding-zero-to-a-Full-Stack-Web-Dev-Hero-in-6-months-and-under-1000-what-would-you-tell-me-to-learn-and-what-online-resources-should-I-use) about how to get into web development when you're a raw beginner to programming generally that are worth checking out.

* [Essential competencies for Rails development](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/this-is-why-learning-rails-is-hard?__s=uvtabrbrcctximf9dhin): Rails is the major web framework for Ruby, and a popular choice for building apps quickly and well.
* [Where to start learning Rails and general webdev concepts](http://www.unforgivableruby.com/post/114752678529/learning-web-developmentrails-without-spending)
* [Web technology for developers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)
* [Code.org courses](https://code.org/learn)
* [Viking School prep course](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/prep)
* [IRN app, JS-based course to learn programming](http://lrnapp.com/)
* [Code Avengers: various free courses to learn basics](https://www.codeavengers.com/profile#intro)
* [TreeHouse, various small courses](https://teamtreehouse.com/)
* [KhanAcademy courses](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
* [Bento](https://bento.io/), cool tutorials for different web development technologies and concepts.
* [Learn the Hard Way courses](http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html), highly recommended.
* [Codeschool](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/): lots of great, interactive tutorials, especially geared towards raw beginners. Some of them are behind paywalls, but it's very reasonable pricing.
* [Videos at Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/)
* [Variety of free online computer science courses from universities](http://wayback.archive-it.org/3671/20150528220118/https://www.extension.harvard.edu/open-learning-initiative/intensive-introduction-computer-science)

## Learning with some help
I really like the idea of [mastery learning](http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/09/how-startups-are-solving-a-decades-old-problem-in-education/), which is when you learn or are taught a concept until you master it, before moving on to the next one. Ideally, you do it with the help of a mentor or community. Here's some places to do that:

* [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming): completely free, Ruby-based full-stack development program, with an amazing online community.
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/): superb, completely free program, teaching from the frontend backwards, with an excellent and huge community which in many cities has local presence. Actively maintained and being expanded to include new courses such as one teaching D3.js.
* [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io/web-developer-career-track): a paid bootcamp whose model is to connect you with a developer who acts as a mentor.
* [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/): similarly to Bloc.io, a paid bootcamp program connecting you to a mentor.

## Survive being a new developer!
* *[Apprenticeship Patterns](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html)*: this awesome book is  free online!
* [Level up as a dev](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-level-up-as-a-developer-87344584777c#.2x5iu4n2i), great article.
* *[New Programmerâ€™s Survival Manual](https://www.amazon.com/New-Programmers-Survival-Manual-Workplace/dp/1934356816)*
