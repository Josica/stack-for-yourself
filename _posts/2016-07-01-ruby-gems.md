## Start here
Ruby gems are modular libraries that are meant to be sort of plug-and-play for Ruby projects and apps. Many are meant for or compatible with Rails.

Check out [Awesome Ruby](https://ruby.libhunt.com/) which shows different gems in groups and compares them (since many gems are out there to support the same features).

### Building your own
Remember not to build your gem within the same directory...that mistake sent me down a strange rabbit hole.

* [RailsCasts: build a new gem with bundler](http://railscasts.com/episodes/245-new-gem-with-bundler), probably the easiest way to get started
* [RubyGems](http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/)'s own guide and documentation for building a new gem. (That's the site that aggregates them and from where you download gems via the `gem install [gem_name]` command.)

<hr>

### Great gems to know
* [bcrypt](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby), for user authentication.
* [pry-rails](https://github.com/rweng/pry-rails), a spectacular breakpoint/debugging tool (quite like `debugger` for the browser JavaScript console)

<hr>

### A general list
* [emittr](https://github.com/talyssonoc/emittr), an event listener.
* [github_api](https://github.com/piotrmurach/github) gem, a Ruby wrapper for making requests to the official Github API.
* [soda-ruby](https://github.com/socrata/soda-ruby), a gem to parse Government Open Data.
