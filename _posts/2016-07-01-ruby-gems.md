## Start here
*nothing here yet!*

<hr>

Resources for Ruby gems, or external modular libraries.

## Building your own
Just remember not to build your gem within the same directory...that mistake sent me down a strange rabbit hole.

* [RailsCasts New Gem with Bundler](http://railscasts.com/episodes/245-new-gem-with-bundler), probably the easiest way to get started
* [RubyGems](http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/)'s own guide to building a new gem. (That's the site that aggregates them and from where you download gems via the `gem install [gem_name]` command.)

<hr>

## Great gems to know
* [bcrypt](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby), for user authentication.
* [Awesome Ruby](https://ruby.libhunt.com/), great place to look at different gems in groups and see
them compared (since many gems are out there to support the same features).
* [github_api](https://github.com/piotrmurach/github) gem, a Ruby wrapper for making requests to the official Github API.

<hr>

## And a general list:
* [emittr](https://github.com/talyssonoc/emittr), an event listener.
