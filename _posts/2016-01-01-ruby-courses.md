## Complete, free, online courses  
[Kickstart](https://github.com/JoshCheek/ruby-kickstart)  
A fantastic full course on Ruby entirely taught through you building to make the included tests pass. Get started simply by forking and pulling down a copy on Github.  

[TestFirst Ruby](https://github.com/appacademy/test-first-ruby)  
Used to be an actual taught course, but the materials are entirely complete on their own. Test-driven: you'll pick up RSpec because the best way to understand what you'll need to write will be in the specc'ed tests.

[Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)  
Complete self-driven course, entirely different from other courses. Steeper learning curve, excellent results. You'll learn by doing. RSpec tests and some commented support included, plus it lays out what your progression should be.

[RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com/)  
One of the most popular interactive Ruby tutorials, walks you all the way from strings and fixnums through metaprogramming.

[Ruby in 100 minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html)  
Exactly as advertised. Great, concise, and short intro to Ruby.

[JumpStart Labs](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/)  
A whole bunch of great Ruby tutorials for different projects.
