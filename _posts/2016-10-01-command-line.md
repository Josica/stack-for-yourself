## Start here
[Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html), a really excellent and concise tutorial getting you up and running with navigating the shell and writing bash commands.

Note that the standard `bash/shell/CLI` comes in large part from a history of Unix computing. Mac computers are Unix-based, so the syntax is in large part the same. But Windows computers do not have a Unix base, although very recently they have started to natively run Linux kernels (which is very cool: Linux is a descendant of Unix in a similar way to the Mac OS). To use command-line functionality on a Windows computer, download [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). Read a bit more about these issues re: Unix, Mac, and Windows in [this Quora question](https://www.quora.com/If-Mac-OS-X-and-Linux-are-based-on-Unix-then-what-is-Windows-based-on-and-why-was-it-implemented-like-this-by-Bill-Gates).
