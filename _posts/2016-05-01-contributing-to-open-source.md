## Start here
Open source contributions are basically when people share code they've written with others, who can use that code for free (although [licensing has an effect on what you can do with open source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses)). This project is open source, for example, in that someone else can come and take the code I've written to build this site and use it elsewhere for other purposes. It's also what makes it possible for you to take a copy of this project, make some changes, and request that those changes be merged into the main project branch.

This site itself is written on technologies that are open-sourced, [Ruby]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/07/01/ruby-overview) and [Jekyll]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/06/01/front-end-part-3-non-js-frameworks) to name a few. So open source code is a way to contribute to the world's codebase as well as a way to showcase your work.

Open source contributions tend to take the form of contributing your work to projects that are already available, but you can also write code for other people to use, for example making a [Ruby gem]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/07/01/ruby-gems).

Girl Develop It put together a great presentation on the topic, [get the PDF here]({{ site.url }}/girl-develop-it-oss.pdf).

### git and Github
[Github](http://github.com) and git are impossible to not bring up when talking about open source. git is a [command-line]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/10/01/command-line) tool that lets you create and transverse a history of your project, making branches to add features or fix bugs while the master branch retains the cleanest and best working copy of your code. Github allows you to share your git repositories and contribute to the git repositories of other people.  

* [git basics](https://git-scm.com/doc): the documentation.
* [Make a gist](https://gist.github.com/): a free way to share code snippets, super useful tool. Can also be embedded in sites!
* [git cheatsheet](http://overapi.com/git) for basic git commands.
* [Github MarkDown tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
* [Learning git branching](http://learngitbranching.js.org/)
* [Make repo show pages on Github using gh-pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/), and [here's Github's intro to it](https://pages.github.com/).

### Find projects to contribute to
You can potentially [pick up on where software is needed](https://medium.com/making-lost-my-name/the-scent-of-software-3bba0d9ab36e#.alat0k7z7) that you can then build, especially if you work around others.

* [Github projects, bugs, and feature requests tagged with beginner-friendly labels](https://github.com/lucev/beginner-friendly) so you can start contributing right away as a beginner.
* [CodeTriage](http://www.codetriage.com/)
* [CodeForAmerica](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), check out their volunteer/code wanted section [here](https://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues).
* [CodeMontage](https://www.codemontage.com/)
* [UpForGrabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/)

### Start your own projects for others to contribute to
You can use tools others have built, such as [open source APIs]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/05/01/open-apis), to create new awesome things. Find more ideas and [build your own portfolio of work]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/05/01/portfolio).
