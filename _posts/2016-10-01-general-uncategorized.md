## Start here
There's some great resources on fundamentals below. Aside from that, be sure to check out our [algorithms]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/09/01/algorithms-uncategorized) and [data structures]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/10/01/back-end-uncategorized) pages, which are also essential computer science concepts.

Watch convention talks on [ConFreaks](http://confreaks.tv/) without paying for the cons themselves.

Some of these resources below, like [this great look at the AI revolution](https://medium.com/ai-revolution/ai-revolution-101-8dce1d9cb62d#.gupjgxmqb), are heavy on concepts and light on code. Others are great introductions.

But things are not always serious... languages can be [kind of ridiculous](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat), you can find yourself [reading all the wrong books](http://imgur.com/gallery/vqUQ5), or possibly even [abandoning it all for the arts](http://classicprogrammerpaintings.com/archive#_=_). But if you stay, [we have cats](https://http.cat/).

## Object Oriented Programming basics
A vast percentage of web development is done with object-oriented languages, including JavaScript. Get very comfortable with how OOP (object-oriented programming) handles concepts and processes.

* [Law of Demeter](http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/07/05/demeter-its-not-just-a-good-idea-its-the-law/)
