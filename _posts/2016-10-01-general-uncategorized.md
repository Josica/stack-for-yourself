## Start here
Watch convention talks on [ConFreaks](http://confreaks.tv/) without paying for the cons themselves.

This is a collection of good general compsci resources. Some of these, like [this great look at the AI revolution](https://medium.com/ai-revolution/ai-revolution-101-8dce1d9cb62d#.gupjgxmqb), are heavy on concepts and light on code. Others are just great introductions.

But it's not always so serious... languages can be [kind of ridiculous](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat), you can find yourself [reading all the wrong books](http://imgur.com/gallery/vqUQ5), or possibly even [abandoning it all for the arts](http://classicprogrammerpaintings.com/archive#_=_). But if you stay, [we have cats](https://http.cat/).

## Internet basics
* [HTTP Basics](http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/http_basics.html), a thorough primer on HTTP.
* [Understanding status codes with Status Cats](https://http.cat/): every HTTP request has a response that is accompanied by a status code like `200 OK` or `500 Internal Server Error`, and these lovely felines can help you remember them.
* [Build a server script to understand how servers work!](http://www.blackbytes.info/2016/08/build-your-own-web-server/) And it's super straightforward with Ruby.

## Object Oriented Programming
* [Law of Demeter](http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/07/05/demeter-its-not-just-a-good-idea-its-the-law/)
* [Understanding Object Oriented Programming](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2014/12/02/why-is-object-oriented-programming-useful-with-an-role-playing-game-example/  )
* [5 Object Oriented basics learned from Sandi Metz](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/06/24/5-lessons-in-object-oriented-design-from-sandi-metz/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email)
