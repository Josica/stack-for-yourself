## Start here
Regardless of whether you're positioning yourself as front-end, back-end, full-stack, QA, or what-have-you...you need projects that showcase those skills.

As a **front-end** developer, for example, you would make sure your Github repositories contain the following:

* At least a couple of from-scratch pages/sites/projects with [your own HTML&CSS]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/06/01/front-end-part-1-html-css-dom)
* Something using a [CSS pre-processor](https://www.sitepoint.com/6-current-options-css-preprocessors/) like [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* A project using [plain JavaScript and something using jQuery and Ajax]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/06/01/javascript-uncategorized)
* Something built with a [JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Ember]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/06/01/javascript-frameworks)
* Several somethings that make use of [non-JS frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, Jekyll, etc.]({{ site.baseurl/2016/06/01/front-end-part-3-non-js-frameworks}})

A **back-end** developer would probably spend less time building front-end projects like those that fit above's list. For them, a good list could include:

* A couple projects built on web frameworks, like [Rails (Ruby's main web framework)]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/07/01/ruby-rails), or [Node (JavaScript for the back-end)]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/06/01/javascript-frameworks), or [.NET (C#'s web framework)](https://www.microsoft.com/net)...the list goes on.
* At least one of those should be built to deliver info via something like [JSON](http://www.w3schools.com/json/), rather than views: in short, built to be an [API]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/05/01/open-apis)
* A repository containing [algorithm problems with your solutions]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/09/01/algorithms-uncategorized), with plenty of comments to showcase your thinking process

So put together at least 10 projects you can talk about to other developers and during interviews, and iterate on them as you learn.
