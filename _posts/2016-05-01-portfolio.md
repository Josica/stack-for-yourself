## Start here
Regardless of whether you're positioning yourself as frontend, backend, full-stack, QA, or what-have-you...you need projects that showcase those skills. As a frontend developer, for example, you would make sure your Github repositories contain the following:

* At least a couple of from-scratch pages/sites/projects with [your own HTML&CSS]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/06/01/frontend-part-1-html-css-dom)
* Something using a [CSS pre-processor](https://www.sitepoint.com/6-current-options-css-preprocessors/) like [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* A project using [plain JavaScript and something using jQuery and Ajax]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/06/01/javascript-uncategorized)
* Something built with a [JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Ember]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/06/01/javascript-frameworks)
* Several somethings that make use of [non-JS frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, Jekyll, etc.]({{ site.baseurl/2016/06/01/frontend-part-3-non-js-frameworks}})

A backend-focused developer would spend less time building frontend projects like those that fit above's list. For them, a good list would probably include:

* A couple projects built on web frameworks, like [Rails (Ruby's main web framework)]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/07/01/ruby-rails), or [Node (JavaScript for the backend)]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/06/01/javascript-frameworks), or [.NET (C#'s web framework)](https://www.microsoft.com/net)...the list goes on.
* At least of those should be built to deliver info via something like [JSON](http://www.w3schools.com/json/), rather than views: in short, built to be an [API]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/05/01/open-apis)
* A repository containing [algorithm problems with your solutions]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/09/01/algorithms-uncategorized), probably well-commented!
