This is a collection of good general compsci resources. Some of these, like [this great and quite deep look at the coming AI revolution](https://medium.com/ai-revolution/ai-revolution-101-8dce1d9cb62d#.gupjgxmqb), are heavy on concepts and light on code. Others are just great introductions.

But it's not always so serious... languages can be [kind of ridiculous](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat), you can find yourself [reading all the wrong books](http://imgur.com/gallery/vqUQ5), or possibly even [abandoning it all for the arts](http://classicprogrammerpaintings.com/archive#_=_). But if you stay, [we have cats](https://http.cat/).

(FYI that last one is actually quite useful.)
