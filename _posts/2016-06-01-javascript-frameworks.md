## Start here

**Prerequisite: [understand how the Internet works, how apps make and respond to requests, and other essential networks]({% post_url 2016-10-01-networking-basics %}).**

There's quite a lot of JavaScript frameworks to choose from! Here's an [article to help you decide which one](https://www.sitepoint.com/top-javascript-frameworks-libraries-tools-use/) you're going to learn.

My 2 cents: Angular.js, developed by Google, and React, developed by Facebook, are [coming out on the very top](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/angular-2-versus-react-there-will-be-blood-66595faafd51#.275mvwu8w). [Angular](#angularjs) looked like it was taking the lead for a while, but now [React](#react) is making a much stronger leap forward, and it looks like it's going to emerge as the winner in terms of popularity, ease of use, and demand.

Learning JavaScript in today's world can be [pretty messy](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.yufaj0qrc), and even experienced developers can find themselves at a loss in this new JavaScript ecosystem.

## Task runners, build tools, and important supporting tools
Whatever framework you choose, [don't flounder among the many build tools and task runners out there](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/making-sense-of-front-end-build-tools-3a1b3a87043b#.aqjw9cj0q). You do ned at least one or two of them in your workflow, so get familiar with the big ones:

* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/build-tools) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (my favorite!)
* [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
* [Bower](https://bower.io/)
