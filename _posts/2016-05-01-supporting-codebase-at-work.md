## Start here

You can potentially [pick up on where software is needed](https://medium.com/making-lost-my-name/the-scent-of-software-3bba0d9ab36e#.alat0k7z7) that you can then build. I would venture to say that your best bet on career development is to do your best to code yourself out of your current role--by writing software so great that it doesn't need anyone to continually add to it.
