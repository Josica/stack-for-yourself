## Foundational concepts
* [Binary search](http://fluxusfrequency.github.io/blog/2014/01/31/building-a-binary-search/)
* [BigO notation cheat sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
* [Sorting algorithms animations](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/), a fantastic place to start learning about different kinds of sorting algorithms.
* [Balancing a binary search tree](http://www.stoimen.com/blog/2012/07/03/computer-algorithms-balancing-a-binary-search-tree/)
* [Removing a node in a binary search tree](http://www.algolist.net/Data_structures/Binary_search_tree/Removal)

## Different kinds of data structures
* [Bloom filters](https://subvisual.co/blog/posts/96-a-look-into-bloom-filters-with-ruby): like Ruby hashes (or hash maps), allows for near-constant-time lookup. A very cool and wierd data structure.
