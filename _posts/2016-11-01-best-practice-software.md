Good design is paramount these days for good software that creates value for users--that is, software that is good and enjoyable to use. I suggest that to that end, a good definition for 'good design' is, *good design is when a creator makes thoughtful decisions by taking into account everything that reasonably impacts their target/known user base*. There's nothing frou-frou or easy about good design, nor is it primarily concerned with how things look. It's a fundamental approach that needs to affect every aspect of your software.
