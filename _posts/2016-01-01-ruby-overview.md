Check out [Team Treehouse's list of awesome Ruby projects](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/coolest-ruby-projects-ever  ). Ruby is written in C, and you can look at [its source code on Github](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/  ) because it's an open source language, which is how you're able to learn it for free. Also, there's a project to
[write a Ruby compiler in Ruby]( http://hokstad.com/compiler) as part of a fun effort to write Ruby in Ruby (as opposed to C).

Definitely [take a look at the Ruby core object model](https://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/5152080) to get a sense for how it organizes itself.

Probably the best reason to learn Ruby is to be able to build awesome things on the web and have a lot of fun while doing it. So check out [Ruby frameworks](/stack-for-yourself/tag/ruby-frameworks/) for info about building with
Ruby on the web.
