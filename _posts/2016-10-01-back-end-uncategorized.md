### [Ruby]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/07/01/ruby-overview)
* [Ruby vs Python](https://hackernoon.com/ruby-vs-python-the-definitive-faq-5cb0046292be#.f3lu2q7a7)

### [Go](https://golang.org/doc/)
A very very cool language developed by Google and currently taking off. Based on the concept of multithreading: opens up new threads to handle new processes and deliver results incredibly quickly.

### The C family
* [Learn C the Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/), a great online tutorial for C (and not necessarily hard..."the hard way" refers to typing up all the code that's presented.)

### [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)
"Fast like C, slick like Ruby": Ruby-like syntax but incredibly fast.
