## Start here
Check out [RosettaCode](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code), a place to see different languages solving the same problems: helps you get a sense of how languages differ in their syntax and philosophies.

Plenty of people suggest you have a systematic approach to learning a new language. [Here is one such suggested plan](https://gist.github.com/CristhianMotoche/85c4f6cdafc23ee92df0bb6ff65ab1be) and I think if you can do all or most of this list with a language of your choosing then you are definitely at the level of being paid to write code. And also to be my hero.

### [Ruby]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/07/01/ruby-overview)
* [Ruby vs Python](https://hackernoon.com/ruby-vs-python-the-definitive-faq-5cb0046292be#.f3lu2q7a7)

### [Go](https://golang.org/doc/)
A very very cool language developed by Google and currently taking off. Based on the concept of multithreading: opens up new threads to handle new processes and deliver results incredibly quickly.

### The C family
* [Learn C the Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/), a great online tutorial for C (and not necessarily hard..."the hard way" refers to typing up all the code that's presented.)
* *[The C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/The-Programming-Language-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=eejs-20&linkId=a2dacad1fa8eed0aa0feaf1d54f70410)*, by Brian Kernighan

### [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)
"Fast like C, slick like Ruby": Ruby-like syntax but incredibly fast.

### [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
A functional programing language with a loving following.

* *[Learn You a Haskell For Greater Good!: A Beginner's Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-You-Haskell-Great-Good/dp/1593272839/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=eejs-20&linkId=f37ff4ad70d012fe595558cbc16f183e)*, by Miran Lipovaca
