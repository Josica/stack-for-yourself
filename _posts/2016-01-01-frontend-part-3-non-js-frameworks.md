## Jekyll
Jekyll is an amazing, lightweight front-end framework for organizing and generating files and partials.
It's got [great documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) and was created by a Github founder. It's an awesome solution for rolling your own blog or small personal site, and can be hosted for free on Github's [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/).

* [Jekyll tags from scratch](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/)
* [Prose.io](http://prose.io/): create md files via a web interface that immediately show up on the appropriate Jekyll site (or just to the appropriate repository).
* [Tags and categories with Jekyll](http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/)

## Bootstrap
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a super important front-end CSS & JS library developed and used by Twitter. Stylistically it brings you the look and feel of a professional product, and tons of people use it. Luckily, their [documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) is really excellent.

* [Bootstrap forms](https://bootstrapbay.com/blog/working-bootstrap-contact-form/)
* [free Bootstrap themes](http://bootswatch.com/)

## Materialize
[Material design](https://material.google.com/#introduction-goals) is a concept developed by Google, which then developed into [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/), a CSS & JS library, currently gaining hugely in popularity over Bootstrap. The docs are [almost as good as Bootstrap's](http://materializecss.com/).

* [Google's Material design resources](https://design.google.com/resources/?gclid=CjwKEAjwrIa9BRD5_dvqqazMrFESJACdv27Gv73GA7-ZeNdzg3VtJ5iOujUMXSEvO0bTQMb7hnqr3xoCiq7w_wcB#resizer)
