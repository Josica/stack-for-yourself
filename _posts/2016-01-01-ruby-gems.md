Resources for Ruby gems, or external modular libraries.

* [bcrypt](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby), for user authentication.
* [Awesome Ruby](https://ruby.libhunt.com/), great place to look at different gems in groups and see

* [github_api](https://github.com/piotrmurach/github) gem, a Ruby wrapper for making requests to the official Github API.
