## Start here
[APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), or *application programming interfaces*, are kind of hard to define. In this context, APIs denote a place somewhere on the internet that accepts requests for certain kinds of data via your computer and sends back responses. Open APIs in this case means essentially databases that you can access via a programming interface.  

[Here's a small tutorial I wrote]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/08/22/accessing-apis-with-ruby) on how to use Ruby to access an API.

Check out [Rise of APIs](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/21/the-rise-of-apis/?ncid=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29), a cool article talking about the current status of APIs.

### Code you'll need to make API calls

#### Ruby
* [Net::HTTP Cheatsheet](http://www.rubyinside.com/nethttp-cheat-sheet-2940.html), best short-and-sweet support for making raw HTTP requests with Ruby, no framework required.
* [HTTP Calls with Ruby](https://blog.codeship.com/http-calls-ruby/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email)
* [unirest](http://unirest.io/ruby), helping you make very clean http requests without the headache of [Net::HTTP](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html) syntax.
