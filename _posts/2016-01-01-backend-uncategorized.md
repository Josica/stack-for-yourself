# Languages
* [Learn C the Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/), a great online tutorial for C (and not necessarily hard..."the hard way" refers to typing up all the code that's presented.)
* [RosettaCode](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code), a place to see different languages solving the same problems!
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/), a very very cool language developed by Google and currently taking off.
