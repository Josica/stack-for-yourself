## Start here
Make sure you [get the right tools installed on your computer](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/installfest) to start developing for the web (still applicable if you aren't going to use Rails).

#### Your most essential tools:
* A grasp of how to use [git and Github]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/05/01/contributing-to-open-source)
* A text-editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/), Github's project, or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), probably the most popular

And take the time to read this great essay on the [maker's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), by Paul Graham of [Y-Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).
