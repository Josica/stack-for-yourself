## Start here
Check out this great roadmap: ["From Zero to Front-end Hero, Part 2"](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-2-adfa4824da9b#.jipjenhuj) ([Part 1 is for HTML&CSS](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-1-7d4f7f0bff02#.sb4dij3lx)).

Learn and use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host your pages and sites: essentially a free, hosted, live version of your front-end repositories.

## Jekyll
Jekyll is an amazing, lightweight front-end framework for organizing and generating files and partials.
It's got [great documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) and was created by a Github founder. It's an awesome solution for rolling your own blog or small personal site, and can be hosted for free on Github's [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/).

* [Jekyll tags from scratch](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/)
* [Prose.io](http://prose.io/): create MD files via a web interface that immediately show up on the appropriate Jekyll site (or just to the appropriate repository).
* [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/): even better than Prose.io, it's a lightweight [content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) that mimics Wordpress' functionality for Jekyll sites.
* [Tags and categories with Jekyll](http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/)
* [Put interactive Ruby snippets on your blog](http://blog.klipse.tech/ruby/2016/06/20/blog-ruby.html)
* [Using static site generators at scale](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/using-a-static-site-generator-at-scale-lessons-learned/): specifically, Jekyll. Great read.
* [Putting Disqus comments onto a Jekyll site](http://estherleytush.com/2016/06/25/adding-comments-to-jekyll-site.html): basically the comments feature below! (And this is a Jekyll site.)
* [Implement Jekyll search using lunr.js](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/): adding search functionality to a Jekyll site
* [Lots of Jekyll themes](https://github.com/drjekyllthemes/themes)
* [Planet Jekyll](http://planetjekyll.github.io/showcase/), an awesome showcase of many Jekyll themes
* [Gorgeous HMFAYSAL Omega theme for Jekyll](https://github.com/hmfaysal/hmfaysal-omega-theme)
* [Create and publish your own Jekyll theme gem](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-and-publish-a-jekyll-theme-gem--cms-27475)

## Bootstrap
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a super important front-end CSS & JS library developed and used by Twitter. Stylistically it brings you the look and feel of a professional product, and tons of people use it. Luckily, their [documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) is really excellent.

* [Bootstrap forms](https://bootstrapbay.com/blog/working-bootstrap-contact-form/)
* [free Bootstrap themes](http://bootswatch.com/)
* [Material Bootstrap design](http://mdbootstrap.com/material-design-for-bootstrap/): lots of great UI pieces to use, a good library to know.

## Materialize
[Material design](https://material.google.com/#introduction-goals) is a concept developed by Google, which then developed into [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/), a CSS & JS library, currently gaining hugely in popularity and competing with Bootstrap. The documentation is [almost as good as Bootstrap's](http://materializecss.com/).

* [Google's Material design resources](https://design.google.com/resources/?gclid=CjwKEAjwrIa9BRD5_dvqqazMrFESJACdv27Gv73GA7-ZeNdzg3VtJ5iOujUMXSEvO0bTQMb7hnqr3xoCiq7w_wcB#resizer)
